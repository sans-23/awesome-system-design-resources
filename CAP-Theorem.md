# CAP Theorem

## What is CAP Theorem?

The CAP theorem, also known as Brewer's theorem (named after computer scientist Eric Brewer), states that it is impossible for a distributed data store to simultaneously provide all three of the following guarantees:

1. **Consistency (C):** All nodes see the same data at the same time
2. **Availability (A):** Every request receives a response (success or failure)
3. **Partition Tolerance (P):** The system continues to operate despite network partitions

**The fundamental principle: You can only achieve two out of these three properties at the same time.**

## The Three Properties Explained

### 1. Consistency

**Definition:** Every read receives the most recent write or an error.

**Characteristics:**
- All nodes have the same view of data at any given time
- After a write, all subsequent reads should return that value
- Strong consistency guarantees immediate consistency
- Often achieved through synchronous replication

**Example:**
- Banking systems where account balance must be accurate
- Inventory management systems
- Booking systems (to prevent double bookings)

### 2. Availability

**Definition:** Every request receives a (non-error) response, without guarantee that it contains the most recent write.

**Characteristics:**
- System remains operational and responsive
- Every request gets a response (though data might be stale)
- No downtime even during failures
- Often achieved through replication

**Example:**
- Social media feeds
- Content delivery networks
- Caching systems

### 3. Partition Tolerance

**Definition:** The system continues to function even when network partitions occur (communication breaks between nodes).

**Characteristics:**
- System operates despite message loss or partial failure
- Network failures don't bring down the entire system
- Critical for distributed systems
- In practice, partition tolerance is not optional for distributed systems

**Example:**
- Any distributed system must handle network issues
- Systems spanning multiple data centers
- Microservices architectures

## The Trade-offs

Since network partitions are inevitable in distributed systems, **partition tolerance is not optional**. Therefore, the real choice is between:

### CP Systems (Consistency + Partition Tolerance)

**Choice:** Sacrifice Availability during network partitions

**Behavior:**
- Returns errors or timeouts when consistency cannot be guaranteed
- Blocks operations until consistency is restored
- Prioritizes data correctness over availability

**Use Cases:**
- Financial transactions
- Inventory management
- Configuration management
- Distributed locking services

**Examples:**
- **MongoDB:** Can be configured for strong consistency
- **HBase:** Strongly consistent
- **Redis Cluster:** With strong consistency mode
- **Zookeeper:** Prioritizes consistency
- **etcd:** Consistent key-value store
- **Consul:** Strong consistency

**Pros:**
- Data accuracy guaranteed
- No conflicting data
- Simpler to reason about

**Cons:**
- System may become unavailable
- Higher latency for operations
- Reduced throughput

### AP Systems (Availability + Partition Tolerance)

**Choice:** Sacrifice Consistency (embrace eventual consistency)

**Behavior:**
- Always responds to requests
- May return stale or inconsistent data
- Eventually converges to consistency
- Prioritizes uptime over immediate accuracy

**Use Cases:**
- Social media platforms
- Shopping carts
- Real-time analytics
- Caching layers
- DNS systems

**Examples:**
- **Cassandra:** Highly available, eventually consistent
- **DynamoDB:** Designed for availability
- **Riak:** AP-focused database
- **CouchDB:** Eventually consistent
- **Voldemort:** Amazon's key-value store
- **DNS:** Classic AP system

**Pros:**
- High availability
- Better performance
- Fault tolerant

**Cons:**
- Temporary inconsistencies
- Complex conflict resolution
- May return stale data

## Real-World Scenarios

### Scenario 1: Banking System (CP)

**Problem:** User transfers $100 from Account A to Account B

**CP Approach:**
- Ensure both accounts are updated atomically
- If network partition occurs, block the transaction
- User sees error but data remains consistent
- Better to fail than show incorrect balance

**Why CP?** Financial accuracy is critical, temporary unavailability is acceptable

### Scenario 2: Social Media Feed (AP)

**Problem:** User posts an update that should appear to all followers

**AP Approach:**
- Accept the post immediately
- Propagate to all replicas asynchronously
- Followers may see the post at different times
- System remains available even with network issues

**Why AP?** User experience matters more than immediate consistency

### Scenario 3: E-commerce Shopping Cart (AP)

**Problem:** User adds items to shopping cart

**AP Approach:**
- Accept additions immediately
- Merge carts from different sessions
- Resolve conflicts (keep all items)
- Verify inventory only at checkout (CP moment)

**Why AP?** Better to let users browse and add items than block them

## Eventual Consistency

**Definition:** Given enough time without updates, all replicas will converge to the same value.

**Characteristics:**
- Common in AP systems
- Temporary inconsistencies are acceptable
- System self-heals over time
- Requires conflict resolution strategies

**Conflict Resolution Strategies:**

1. **Last Write Wins (LWW):**
   - Use timestamp to determine latest write
   - Simple but may lose data
   - Used in Cassandra

2. **Version Vectors:**
   - Track causality of updates
   - Detect concurrent writes
   - Used in Riak, Voldemort

3. **CRDTs (Conflict-free Replicated Data Types):**
   - Data structures designed to merge automatically
   - Mathematically proven to converge
   - Used in Riak, Redis

4. **Application-level Resolution:**
   - Let application decide how to merge
   - Most flexible but requires custom logic
   - Used in DynamoDB

## Beyond CAP: PACELC

The PACELC theorem extends CAP:

**Statement:** 
- **If Partition (P):** Choose between Availability (A) and Consistency (C)
- **Else (E):** Choose between Latency (L) and Consistency (C)

This recognizes that even without partitions, there's a trade-off between latency and consistency.

## Common Misconceptions

### Misconception 1: "NoSQL databases are AP, SQL databases are CP"

**Reality:** 
- Both SQL and NoSQL can be configured differently
- PostgreSQL can be configured for AP (async replication)
- Cassandra can be tuned for CP (strong consistency levels)

### Misconception 2: "You must choose one combination forever"

**Reality:**
- Systems can switch between modes
- Different parts of the same system can make different choices
- Tunable consistency (Cassandra allows per-query consistency level)

### Misconception 3: "CAP is binary"

**Reality:**
- Consistency and availability exist on spectrums
- You can tune the level of each property
- Different operations can have different guarantees

### Misconception 4: "Partition tolerance is optional"

**Reality:**
- In distributed systems, network partitions WILL happen
- You cannot choose CA in a distributed system
- The real choice is between CP and AP

## Practical Considerations

### When to Choose CP

✅ **Choose CP when:**
- Data correctness is critical
- Financial transactions involved
- Inventory management
- Booking systems
- Configuration data
- You can tolerate temporary unavailability

**Implementation Tips:**
- Use distributed consensus (Paxos, Raft)
- Implement two-phase commit
- Use strongly consistent databases
- Set up proper timeouts and retries

### When to Choose AP

✅ **Choose AP when:**
- User experience is priority
- Temporary inconsistencies are acceptable
- High availability is required
- Massive scale is needed
- Eventual consistency is sufficient

**Implementation Tips:**
- Implement conflict resolution
- Use versioning systems
- Design for eventual consistency
- Communicate inconsistencies to users when necessary

## Hybrid Approaches

Many real-world systems don't strictly follow CP or AP:

### Multi-Model Systems
- Use CP for critical data (transactions, inventory)
- Use AP for non-critical data (user preferences, caches)

### Tunable Consistency
- **Cassandra:** Allows specifying consistency level per query
  - ONE, QUORUM, ALL
- **DynamoDB:** Offers strongly consistent reads as an option

### Geographic Considerations
- Strong consistency within a region (CP)
- Eventual consistency across regions (AP)

## Tools and Technologies

### CP Systems
- **Databases:** MongoDB, HBase, MemSQL, VoltDB
- **Coordination:** Zookeeper, etcd, Consul
- **Distributed SQL:** CockroachDB, Google Spanner

### AP Systems
- **Databases:** Cassandra, DynamoDB, Riak, CouchDB
- **Caches:** Redis (with clustering), Memcached
- **CDNs:** Cloudflare, Akamai

### Tunable Systems
- **Cassandra:** Configurable consistency levels
- **MongoDB:** Read/write concerns
- **DynamoDB:** Eventual vs. strong reads
