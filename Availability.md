# Availability

## What is Availability?

Availability refers to the amount of time a system remains operational and accessible when required for use.

It is typically expressed as a percentage of uptime in a given year. High availability systems are designed to minimize downtime and ensure continuous operation.

## Measuring Availability

Availability is calculated using the formula:

```
Availability = (Uptime / (Uptime + Downtime)) Ã— 100%
```

### The "Nines" of Availability

| Availability % | Downtime per Year | Downtime per Month | Downtime per Week | Common Name |
|----------------|-------------------|--------------------|--------------------|-------------|
| 90% | 36.5 days | 72 hours | 16.8 hours | One nine |
| 99% | 3.65 days | 7.2 hours | 1.68 hours | Two nines |
| 99.9% | 8.76 hours | 43.8 minutes | 10.1 minutes | Three nines |
| 99.99% | 52.6 minutes | 4.38 minutes | 1.01 minutes | Four nines |
| 99.999% | 5.26 minutes | 26.3 seconds | 6.05 seconds | Five nines |
| 99.9999% | 31.5 seconds | 2.63 seconds | 0.605 seconds | Six nines |

## Key Components of High Availability

### 1. Redundancy

Duplicating critical components to eliminate single points of failure.

**Types of Redundancy:**
- **Active-Active:** All instances actively handle traffic
- **Active-Passive:** Backup instances stand by and take over during failure
- **N+1 Redundancy:** One extra component beyond minimum requirements
- **N+2 Redundancy:** Two extra components for higher reliability

### 2. Fault Tolerance

The ability of a system to continue operating even when some components fail.

**Techniques:**
- Redundant hardware components
- Error detection and correction
- Graceful degradation
- Automatic failover

### 3. Replication

Maintaining multiple copies of data across different locations.

**Replication Strategies:**
- **Synchronous Replication:** Data is written to multiple locations simultaneously
  - Pros: Strong consistency, no data loss
  - Cons: Higher latency, reduced throughput

- **Asynchronous Replication:** Data is written to primary first, then replicated
  - Pros: Lower latency, higher throughput
  - Cons: Potential data loss, eventual consistency

### 4. Load Balancing

Distributing workload across multiple servers to prevent any single server from becoming a bottleneck.

**Benefits:**
- Improved response time
- Increased throughput
- Better resource utilization
- Enhanced fault tolerance

### 5. Monitoring and Alerting

Continuous monitoring of system health and automatic alerting when issues arise.

**Key Metrics to Monitor:**
- System uptime
- Response time
- Error rates
- Resource utilization (CPU, memory, disk, network)
- Database performance

## Availability Patterns

### 1. Failover

Automatically switching to a standby system when the primary system fails.

**Types:**
- **Hot Failover:** Standby system is running and ready
- **Warm Failover:** Standby system is partially running
- **Cold Failover:** Standby system starts only when needed

### 2. Backup and Recovery

Regularly backing up data and having procedures to restore it.

**Backup Strategies:**
- Full backups
- Incremental backups
- Differential backups
- Continuous data protection

**Recovery Metrics:**
- **RTO (Recovery Time Objective):** Maximum acceptable downtime
- **RPO (Recovery Point Objective):** Maximum acceptable data loss

### 3. Geographic Distribution

Distributing services across multiple geographic locations.

**Benefits:**
- Protection against regional outages
- Reduced latency for users
- Compliance with data residency requirements

### 4. Circuit Breaker Pattern

Preventing cascading failures by failing fast when a dependency is unavailable.

**States:**
- **Closed:** Normal operation
- **Open:** Fail fast, don't call failing service
- **Half-Open:** Test if service has recovered

### 5. Graceful Degradation

Continuing to provide reduced functionality when some components fail.

**Example:**
- Serve static content when dynamic features fail
- Show cached data when database is unavailable
- Disable non-critical features under high load

## High Availability Architecture

### Multi-Tier Architecture

**Presentation Tier:**
- Multiple web servers behind load balancer
- CDN for static content
- Auto-scaling groups

**Application Tier:**
- Stateless application servers
- Horizontal scaling
- Service mesh for communication

**Data Tier:**
- Database replication
- Read replicas
- Data sharding

### Cloud Availability Zones

**Region:** Geographic area containing multiple availability zones

**Availability Zone:** Isolated location within a region
- Independent power, cooling, and networking
- Low-latency connections between zones
- Deploy applications across multiple zones

## Strategies to Improve Availability

### 1. Eliminate Single Points of Failure (SPOF)

**Identify SPOFs:**
- Single server instances
- Single database
- Single network path
- Single data center

**Mitigation:**
- Add redundancy at every layer
- Use multiple availability zones
- Implement automatic failover

### 2. Design for Failure

**Principles:**
- Assume everything will fail
- Build self-healing systems
- Implement timeout and retry logic
- Use bulkheads to isolate failures

### 3. Implement Health Checks

**Types:**
- **Shallow Health Checks:** Basic connectivity tests
- **Deep Health Checks:** Test critical dependencies

**Use Cases:**
- Load balancer routing decisions
- Auto-scaling triggers
- Alerting and monitoring

### 4. Use Chaos Engineering

Intentionally injecting failures to test system resilience.

**Tools:**
- Chaos Monkey (Netflix)
- Gremlin
- Chaos Toolkit

**Benefits:**
- Identify weaknesses before they cause outages
- Validate failover mechanisms
- Build confidence in system reliability

### 5. Implement Rate Limiting

Protecting systems from overload by limiting request rates.

**Benefits:**
- Prevent resource exhaustion
- Ensure fair resource allocation
- Protect against DDoS attacks

## Availability vs. Consistency

### CAP Theorem

In distributed systems, you can only achieve two out of three:

**Consistency:** All nodes see the same data at the same time

**Availability:** Every request receives a response

**Partition Tolerance:** System continues operating despite network failures

### Trade-offs

**CP (Consistency + Partition Tolerance):**
- Sacrifice availability during network partitions
- Example: Banking systems, inventory management

**AP (Availability + Partition Tolerance):**
- Sacrifice consistency, embrace eventual consistency
- Example: Social media feeds, analytics systems

## Cost vs. Availability

Higher availability comes with increased costs:

**Costs to Consider:**
